## v3.0 - February 2026

### New Features
- **Sticky session endpoint affinity** — Same session ID now routes to the same upstream endpoint via Redis-backed affinity
- **IP whitelist on shared port** — Whitelist authentication now works on the main port (`1318`) alongside password auth, no separate ports needed
- **Database-backed architecture** — Pools, sources, and endpoints migrated from config files to PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Provider adapter system** — Geo parameter translation for upstream providers (e.g., Massive)
- **Usage tracking pipeline** — Real-time bandwidth tracking via Redis counters with periodic flush to PostgreSQL

### Improvements
- IP whitelist management UI in Dashboard with real-time add/remove
- Reserved IP blocking (private/loopback ranges rejected)
- Session and TTL fields logged in access log for debugging
