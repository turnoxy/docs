IP whitelist authentication allows you to make requests without a password by pre-registering your IP addresses.

## How It Works

1. Add your IP address to the whitelist in the Dashboard
2. Make requests from that IP without a password
3. Only the username (with parameters) is required

## Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Binding Level | Per Subscription |
| Max IPs | 3 per subscription |
| Format | IPv4 address |

## Usage

When making requests from a whitelisted IP, omit the password:

```bash
# From a whitelisted IP - no password needed
curl -x "http://sub_k8mX2pL9-country-US@proxy.turnoxy.com:1318" \
     https://example.com
```

Compare with password authentication:

```bash
# Standard password authentication
curl -x "http://sub_k8mX2pL9-country-US:Qw4nR7vB3xY9mK2p@proxy.turnoxy.com:1318" \
     https://example.com
```

## Managing Whitelist

You can manage your whitelisted IPs in the [Dashboard](https://turnoxy.com/dashboard):

1. Go to **Settings** → **IP Whitelist**
2. Click **Add IP**
3. Enter your IPv4 address
4. Save changes

<Warning>
Changes take effect immediately. Make sure you're adding the correct IP address.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

- **Servers with static IPs** - No need to store credentials in config files
- **Automated scripts** - Simpler configuration without password management
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Whitelist your runner IPs for secure access

## Limitations

- IPv4 only (IPv6 not supported)
- Single IP addresses only (CIDR ranges not supported)
- Maximum 3 IPs per subscription
