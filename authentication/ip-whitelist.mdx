title: "IP Whitelist"
description: "Authenticate without password using whitelisted IPs"
---

Pre-register your IP addresses to skip password authentication.

## How It Works

1. Add your IP to the whitelist in Dashboard
2. Make requests without password
3. Only username (with parameters) required

## Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Binding Level | Per Subscription |
| Max IPs | 2 per subscription (varies by plan) |
| Format | IPv4 address |
| Label | Optional (letters, numbers, underscores, max 15 chars) |

## Usage

From a whitelisted IP, omit the password:

```bash
# IP whitelist (no password)
curl -x "http://sub_xxx-country-US@gate.turnoxy.com:1318" https://example.com

# Password auth (for comparison)
curl -x "http://sub_xxx-country-US:pass@gate.turnoxy.com:1318" https://example.com
```

## Adding IPs to Whitelist

### Step-by-Step

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Go to [Dashboard](https://turnoxy.com/dashboard)
   - Select your subscription

2. **Access IP Whitelist**
   - Scroll to **IP WHITELIST** section
   - Click **+ ADD IP** button

3. **Enter IP Details**
   - **IP Address** (required): Enter your IPv4 address (e.g., `1.1.1.1`)
   - **Label** (optional): Add a friendly name (e.g., `Office_IP`)

4. **Confirm**
   - Click **Add IP**
   - IP takes effect immediately

### Quota Limits

- Each subscription has a limit (typically **2 IPs**)
- Limit varies by plan tier
- When quota is full, the **+ ADD IP** button is disabled
- Hover over disabled button to see quota message

### Removing IPs

- Hover over an IP card to reveal the delete icon
- Click the **×** icon to remove
- Confirm the deletion in the dialog
- Removal takes effect immediately

<Warning>
Changes (additions and deletions) take effect immediately.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

- **Static IP servers** - No credentials in config files
- **Automation** - Simpler configuration
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Whitelist runner IPs

## Limitations

- **IPv4 only** - IPv6 not supported
- **Single IPs only** - CIDR notation not supported
- **Quota limits** - 2 IPs per subscription (varies by plan)
- **Label format** - Letters, numbers, underscores only (max 15 characters)
- **Global uniqueness** - Each IP can only be whitelisted once across all subscriptions
