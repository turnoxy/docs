title: "IP Whitelist"
description: "Authenticate without credentials using whitelisted IPs"
---

Pre-register your IP addresses to skip credential authentication entirely.

## How It Works

1. Add your server IP to the whitelist in Dashboard
2. Make requests from that IP — no username or password needed
3. The proxy automatically identifies your subscription by IP

## Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Endpoint | `gate.turnoxy.com:1318` (same as password auth) |
| Binding Level | Per Subscription |
| Max IPs | 2 per subscription (varies by plan) |
| Format | IPv4 only |

## Usage

From a whitelisted IP, simply point your client at the proxy — no credentials required:

```bash
# IP whitelist — no credentials
curl -x "http://gate.turnoxy.com:1318" https://example.com

# For comparison, password auth on the same port
curl -x "http://sub_xxx:pass@gate.turnoxy.com:1318" https://example.com
```

Both authentication methods work on the same endpoint (`gate.turnoxy.com:1318`). If credentials are provided, password auth takes priority regardless of IP whitelist status.

### SOCKS5

```bash
# IP whitelist via SOCKS5
curl --socks5 gate.turnoxy.com:1318 https://example.com
```

## Adding IPs to Whitelist

### Step-by-Step

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Go to [Dashboard](https://turnoxy.com/dashboard)
   - Select your subscription

2. **Access IP Whitelist**
   - Scroll to **IP WHITELIST** section
   - Click **+ ADD IP** button

3. **Enter IP Details**
   - **IP Address** (required): Enter your IPv4 address (e.g., `1.1.1.1`)
   - **Label** (optional): Add a friendly name (e.g., `Office_IP`)

4. **Confirm**
   - Click **Add IP**
   - IP takes effect immediately

### Quota Limits

- Each subscription has a limit (typically **2 IPs**)
- Limit varies by plan tier
- When quota is full, the **+ ADD IP** button is disabled

### Removing IPs

- Hover over an IP card to reveal the delete icon
- Click the **x** icon to remove
- Removal takes effect immediately

<Warning>
Each IP address can only be whitelisted by one subscription across the entire system. If you need to move an IP to a different subscription, remove it first.
</Warning>

## Differences from Password Auth

| Feature | Password Auth | IP Whitelist |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Credentials required | Yes | No |
| Proxy parameters (country, session, etc.) | Yes (via username) | No |
| Session stickiness | Configurable | Rotate only |
| Geo-targeting | Yes | No |
| Usage tracking | Yes | Yes |
| Balance checking | Yes | Yes |

<Note>
Since there is no username to embed parameters in, IP whitelist auth always uses the default pool with rotating IPs. If you need geo-targeting or sticky sessions, use password authentication.
</Note>

## Use Cases

- **Static IP servers** — No credentials in config files
- **Automation** — Simplest possible configuration
- **CI/CD pipelines** — Whitelist runner IPs

## Limitations

- **IPv4 only** — IPv6 addresses not supported
- **Single IPs only** — CIDR notation not supported
- **No proxy parameters** — Country, session, TTL not available
- **Quota limits** — 2 IPs per subscription (varies by plan)
- **Global uniqueness** — Each IP can only be whitelisted once across all subscriptions
